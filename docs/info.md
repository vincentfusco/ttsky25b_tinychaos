## How it works

An analog circuit that solves a system of non-linear differential equations known as the Lorenz equations (1963). These equations were first studied by Edward Lorenz when he was first trying to model atmospheric convection. This system of equations, which is entirely deterministic, appears at first glance to yield unpredictable solutions. These unpredictable outcomes, it was discovered, was due to seemingly insignificant differences in initial conditions, thus Chaos Theory was born and its focus was to study dynamical systems that have extreme dependence on initial conditions. The classic "butterfly effect". 

## How to test

Configure the MUX with these settings:

Foo foo foo.

Connect V_OUT_1 and V_OUT_2 to oscilloscope inputs. Plot X vs. Y mode. Observe the butterly pattern.

## External hardware

Oscilloscope with ability to plot in X vs. Y mode.
